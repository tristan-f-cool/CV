			<p><em><strong>
				Dear Hiring Manager, <br><br>
				
				I am an Electrical/Computer Engineer with a strong background in software development and hardware product design 
				as well as project planing and team management.<br>
				My career has taken me to different continents and expands acrosse multiple industries and roles.<br><br>
				
				My last role was a very fast-paced Sales Engineering role for medical and automative applications. <br>
				I managed several accounts designing, pitching and selling custom motor and driver solutions as well as customised haptic products. <br>
				My role also required planning a product's life cycle through manufacturing and marketing. <br><br>
				
				My developer career began in aerospace, working on Avionics Flight Control and traffic systems for full-flight simulators. <br>
				This highly regulated industry taught me proper standards and practices in C++ and C# TDD <br>
				as well as how to work high profile contracts like Airbus, Boeing and Bombardier.<br><br>
				
				The next adventure in my career lead me to entrepreneurship.<br>
				I became the CTO and co-founder of a UK automotive IoT Augmented Reality company creating a Heads-Up Display console for commercial vehicles.<br>
				We raised funds, built a team, developed a product and engaged customer trial sales. <br>
				I managed a team of engineers, lead the Agile sprints and releases for the enterprise software portal. <br>
				I personally developed the firmware and power circuit PCBs. <br>
				I hold 3 patents pending and have traveled to London, Germany and Hong Kong/China <br>
				to manufacture and present my design to the likes of McLaren, Ford and Volvo. <br><br>
				
				In university, I developed Android apps for my personal martial arts training and university lacrosse sports team.<br>
				I was also extremely active in university clubs and projects working on competition drones, robots and racecars <br>
				as well as being elected President of the IEEE Student Branch.<br><br>
				
				I am seeking a pivotal role in a team where I can be close to the customer and product and move up quickly in my career. <br>
				I am seeking an opportunity to put my technical and entrepreneurial skills to use. <br>
				I am confident I can make a large contribution in the design and sales process because of my experience and persona. <br>
				I am a confident communicator who is a quick learner capable of teaching,code-reviewing, peer-coding and documenting.<br>
				I lead an eco-friendly lifestyle, stay fit and have many hobbies. I am confident communicator and know when to ask for help.<br><br>
				
				I sincerely thank you for your consideration, <br><br>
				
				Tristan Cool<br>
